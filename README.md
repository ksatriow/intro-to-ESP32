# **Contribution**

I highly encourage the community to step forward and improve this library further. You can fix any reported bug, propose or implement new features, write tests, etc.

Here is a quick list of things to remember -
* Check the open issues before creating a new one,
* Help me in reducing the number of open issues by fixing any existing bugs,
* Check the roadmap to see if you can help in implementing any new feature,
* You can contribute by writing unit and integration tests for this library,
* If you have any new idea that aligns with the goal of this library, feel free to raise a feature request and discuss it.
